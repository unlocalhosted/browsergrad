# Package Requirements Implementation Ledger

- **Normative source:**
  [`docs/platform/package-requirements-lld.md`](../platform/package-requirements-lld.md)
- **Ledger status:** active
- **Last updated:** 2026-07-15
- **Current implementation slice:** Gate 0 audit and Gate 1 foundation design

This is the durable implementation and recovery record for the semantic-systems
architecture. Update it after every implementation slice, material decision,
verification run, failure, or scope change. It records what happened; it does
not weaken or replace the normative requirements in the LLD.

## Status Vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `not-started` | No implementation work or current evidence. |
| `audit` | Existing behavior and ownership are being inventoried. |
| `in-progress` | The gate has an active implementation slice. |
| `partial` | Useful capability landed, but the gate exit criteria are not met. |
| `blocked` | A named dependency or unresolved decision prevents progress. |
| `verified` | Gate exit criteria have current, recorded evidence. |
| `superseded` | Replaced by a recorded decision and migration path. |

`verified` is the only status that means a gate is complete. Passing one narrow
test does not make a gate verified unless every exit criterion is covered.

## Gate Ledger

| Gate | Status | Current result | Missing before `verified` | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gate 0 — freeze and inventory | `in-progress` | Audits completed. Existing checks are compiler-local and do not freeze adapters. Frozen baselines and ownership gaps are now identified; the normative adapter ledger has all five required fields. | Add enforceable workspace/frozen-adapter checks; record dtype/view/materialization inventory; define stable IDs; run negative and repository checks. | Audit findings below. |
| Gate 1 — value/layout core and wire foundation | `in-progress` | Private package shell now exists with only `/schema`, `/layout`, and `/package.json` exports. Semantic implementation is not yet claimed. | Implement canonical schemas/hashes, verifier, cross-language fixtures, resource and arithmetic limits; prove deterministic parity and meaning. | Package shell; tests pending. |
| Gate 2 — multi-frontend, multi-backend view slice | `not-started` | No implementation in this workstream. | All Gate 2 exit criteria. | None. |
| Gate 3 — real C++/CuTe frontend slice | `not-started` | No implementation in this workstream. | All Gate 3 exit criteria. | None. |
| Gate 4 — tiled GEMM and schedule separation | `not-started` | No implementation in this workstream. | All Gate 4 exit criteria. | None. |
| Gate 5 — tiled attention flagship | `not-started` | No implementation in this workstream. | All Gate 5 exit criteria. | None. |
| Gate 6 — framework convergence | `not-started` | No implementation in this workstream. | All Gate 6 exit criteria. | None. |
| Gate 7 — host graphs and optional systems expansion | `not-started` | No implementation in this workstream. | All Gate 7 exit criteria. | None. |

## Active Slice

### Objective

Establish a trustworthy Gate 0 baseline, then land the smallest Gate 1
foundation that owns shared value/layout semantics without creating empty IR
shells or another frontend-shaped execution path.

### Work in flight

| Work item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Frozen-adapter inventory | `partial` | Baselines recorded for `cute_static_layout`, 44-op shape/f32 `TensorGpuPlan`, and 36 executable `OP_CUSTOM` constructors. Machine enforcement remains. |
| Semantic-core seam audit | `partial` | Existing compiler/JIT/kernels types must adapt into the core; none can be moved wholesale. Exact initial package split is selected. |
| Test-topology analysis | `verified` | TypeScript + Vitest; no specialized catalog match, so native focused Vitest route is recorded locally. |
| Gate 0 architecture check | `in-progress` | Implement workspace boundaries and semantic freeze manifest/check. |
| Gate 1 package design | `partial` | `/schema` and `/layout` only; no root barrel or empty future subpaths. Exact wire/arithmetic corrections are now normative. |

### Audit findings recorded so far

- Public compiler and kernels packages ship unbundled ESM and their release
  test rejects leaked `workspace:` dependencies. An unpublished private
  semantic-core package would therefore make installed public consumers
  unresolved once they import it at runtime.
- The LLD now permits `private` only during standalone Gate 1 incubation and
  requires a packed/release-tested `0.x` package before public-package runtime
  adoption. The alternative bundling path requires explicit proof and is not
  the current repository strategy.
- Existing architecture checks cover compiler-local cycles, removed AST
  backends, representation purity, and line budgets, but not cross-package
  direction, frozen adapters, stable capability IDs, or core `CUSTOM` growth.
- `cute_static_layout` is rank-one parser sugar; `TensorGpuPlan` is a 44-op
  shape-only/f32 backend compatibility plan; JIT has 36 executable
  `OP_CUSTOM` construction sites. None currently has a machine freeze.
- Compiler semantic types remain CUDA/source-shaped, kernels plan types mix
  scheduling and execution, and JIT plan types own framework scheduling. They
  are adapter inputs, not semantic-core source material.
- The LLD's initial view model conflated geometry and effects and used constant
  offsets despite dynamic shape support. It now uses symbolic byte lengths and
  offsets, puts access mode in L2 effects, and makes normalized `IndexMap` the
  sole executable coordinate truth.
- A second design audit found L1 allocation geometry mixed with L4 ownership
  and binding, content-derived IDs that would collapse distinct identical
  entities, an impossible freeze-then-brand order, and unbounded BigInt growth.
  The LLD now separates allocation spec/binding, scopes entity IDs, brands
  wrappers before freezing, and budgets integer width plus arithmetic work.

### Current constraints

- Preserve unrelated user changes in the dirty worktree.
- Do not claim a capability tier above its evidence.
- Do not add empty public abstractions merely to mirror the target package map.
- Keep the semantic core browser-safe and independent of frontend, runtime,
  Python, WebGPU, and native backend internals.
- New tests must follow the repository's discovered framework and focused gate.

## Decision Log

| ID | Date | Status | Decision | Reason / consequence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-001 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Keep this implementation ledger separate from the normative LLD and link them both ways. | Mutable state can change without silently changing architectural requirements. |
| D-002 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Gate completion requires all recorded exit criteria and evidence; partial implementation remains `partial`. | Prevents test counts or one successful demo from overstating completion. |
| D-003 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Begin with Gate 0 enforcement and concrete Gate 1 `/schema` and `/layout` capabilities; do not pre-create empty kernel, schedule, host, or capability APIs. | Audits confirmed existing models cannot move wholesale and speculative entrypoints would freeze the wrong seams. |
| D-004 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Treat semantic-core as private only during standalone incubation; publish and release-test it as `0.x` before any public unbundled package ships a runtime dependency on it. | Prevents workspace-only success followed by broken npm installations while preserving an explicitly unstable internal API. |
| D-005 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Normalize `LayoutExpr` into one executable `IndexMap`; keep dimension symbols, logical coordinates, and predicates as separate expression domains. | Prevents two serialized coordinate truths and accidental symbol-kind ambiguity. |
| D-006 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Semantic hashes use SHA-256 over canonical UTF-8 JSON, exclude provenance/transport metadata, and compose named components through a domain-separated canonical record. | Removes circular IDs, undocumented cache salt, and cross-language float/string ambiguity. |
| D-007 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Keep allocation geometry and alias identity in L1 `AllocationSpec`; keep ownership and runtime binding in L4 `AllocationBinding`. | Prevents value/layout artifacts from owning host lifecycle state or duplicating binding truth. |
| D-008 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Content-address only pure value nodes; derive identity-bearing entity IDs from deterministic artifact scope and canonical entity position. | Distinct identical allocations and views retain separate alias/lifecycle identity. |
| D-009 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Enforce integer-bit and arithmetic-operation budgets; deep-freeze normalized artifacts before placing them in an immutable opaque verified wrapper. | Closes BigInt denial-of-service and impossible post-freeze mutation paths. |
| D-010 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | V1 uses a closed byte-addressable scalar dtype registry and an affine/strided index algebra; swizzles and sub-byte storage require named extensions. | Prevents strings and backend spellings from becoming dtype/layout semantics before their bit rules exist. |
| D-011 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Minor additions are restricted to open bags with lossless unknown-field preservation; closed semantic records change only by major version or required extension. | Keeps old-reader canonical hashes stable instead of silently dropping new payload meaning. |

Provisional decisions MUST be accepted, replaced, or rejected before the
affected implementation slice is marked complete.

## Change Log

### 2026-07-15 — Ledger created

- Added this durable gate/status/decision/evidence record at the user's request.
- Added `.wibey-test/` to `.gitignore` for local test-orchestration state.
- Started three read-only parallel audits: Gate 0, semantic-core seams, and test
  topology.
- Corrected the LLD's private-package direction after the seam audit found it
  incompatible with the repository's public unbundled package model.
- No architecture gate or semantic-core implementation is claimed complete.

## Verification Log

| Date | Scope | Command | Result | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-15 | Ledger creation | Not applicable | Documentation only; verification not yet run. | Run `git diff --check` with the first implementation slice. |

## Failure and Recovery Log

Record failures that may matter after context loss. Include the exact failing
command, concise error, suspected cause, resolution or next experiment, and
whether any files may be left partially changed.

No implementation failures recorded yet.

## Quick Resume Checklist

1. Read this ledger, then the relevant gate and exit criteria in the normative
   LLD.
2. Check `git status --short`; assume unrelated dirty files belong to the user.
3. Review the latest decision, verification, and failure entries before reading
   source broadly.
4. Resume only the current slice or explicitly record a scope change.
5. After work: update gate status, changed files, commands/results, failures,
   decisions, and the next smallest checkpoint.

## Next Checkpoint

Record all three audit findings, choose the exact Gate 0 enforcement mechanism
and Gate 1 package surface, then update D-003 before editing implementation
source.
