# Package Requirements Implementation Ledger

- **Normative source:**
  [`docs/platform/package-requirements-lld.md`](../platform/package-requirements-lld.md)
- **Ledger status:** active
- **Last updated:** 2026-07-15
- **Current implementation slice:** Gate 0 remaining behavior and vocabulary freezes

This is the durable implementation and recovery record for the semantic-systems
architecture. Update it after every implementation slice, material decision,
verification run, failure, or scope change. It records what happened; it does
not weaken or replace the normative requirements in the LLD.

## Status Vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `not-started` | No implementation work or current evidence. |
| `audit` | Existing behavior and ownership are being inventoried. |
| `in-progress` | The gate has an active implementation slice. |
| `partial` | Useful capability landed, but the gate exit criteria are not met. |
| `blocked` | A named dependency or unresolved decision prevents progress. |
| `verified` | Gate exit criteria have current, recorded evidence. |
| `superseded` | Replaced by a recorded decision and migration path. |

`verified` is the only status that means a gate is complete. Passing one narrow
test does not make a gate verified unless every exit criterion is covered.

## Gate Ledger

| Gate | Status | Current result | Missing before `verified` | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gate 0 — freeze and inventory | `partial` | Workspace dependency/import direction and five legacy adapters are machine-frozen. Stable diagnostic stages, the implemented layout/index-map semantic capability ID, three backend IDs, and 53 classified legacy assignment requirements are registered separately. Compiler pointer/scalar and runtime requirement behavior have executable fixtures. | Add the machine-readable dtype/view/materialization and exact opaque-operation inventories; freeze Grad view/bf16 and exact JIT opaque-operation decisions. | `pnpm architecture:check`; compiler semantic-architecture, pointer/scalar, and runtime assignment-requirement tests. |
| Gate 1 — value/layout core and wire foundation | `verified` | The private package implements the bounded wire/value/layout contract, closed `browsergrad.layout@1` verification, authority-bound opaque artifacts, content-scoped IDs, deterministic normalization, and coordinate/address/alias traces. An independent Python reference matches TypeScript normalization, full-envelope canonicalization, semantic hashes, and traces for pinned static and symbolic fixtures. | None for Gate 1. Public-package adoption still requires the separate packed/release-tested `0.x` transition recorded in D-004. | Semantic-core typecheck/build/lint; 8 files and 68 tests; two pinned cross-language fixtures; 14 verifier rejection mutations; dynamic trace rejection and dominating-predicate parity; architecture check. |
| Gate 2 — multi-frontend, multi-backend view slice | `not-started` | No implementation in this workstream. | All Gate 2 exit criteria. | None. |
| Gate 3 — real C++/CuTe frontend slice | `not-started` | No implementation in this workstream. | All Gate 3 exit criteria. | None. |
| Gate 4 — tiled GEMM and schedule separation | `not-started` | No implementation in this workstream. | All Gate 4 exit criteria. | None. |
| Gate 5 — tiled attention flagship | `not-started` | No implementation in this workstream. | All Gate 5 exit criteria. | None. |
| Gate 6 — framework convergence | `not-started` | No implementation in this workstream. | All Gate 6 exit criteria. | None. |
| Gate 7 — host graphs and optional systems expansion | `not-started` | No implementation in this workstream. | All Gate 7 exit criteria. | None. |

## Active Slice

### Objective

Establish a trustworthy Gate 0 baseline, then land the smallest Gate 1
foundation that owns shared value/layout semantics without creating empty IR
shells or another frontend-shaped execution path.

### Work in flight

| Work item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Frozen-adapter inventory | `partial` | Baselines recorded and machine-enforced for compiler pointer/scalar memory, `cute_static_layout`, 44-op shape/f32 `TensorGpuPlan`, 36 executable `OP_CUSTOM` constructors, and runtime assignment requirement mapping. Grad and exact opaque-operation decisions remain. |
| Semantic-core seam audit | `partial` | Existing compiler/JIT/kernels types must adapt into the core; none can be moved wholesale. Exact initial package split is selected. |
| Test-topology analysis | `verified` | TypeScript + Vitest; no specialized catalog match, so native focused Vitest route is recorded locally. |
| Gate 0 architecture check | `partial` | Cross-package boundaries, generated-source parity, five required legacy freezes, exact runtime mapping/status unions, reviewed vocabulary, generated profile-usage parity, behavior-fixture IDs, and representative mutation tests are implemented and wired into delivery gates. Grad and exact JIT behavior inventories remain. |
| Gate 1 schema/value core | `verified` | `/schema` and `/layout` only; all Gate 1 requirements and the explicit cross-language exit are covered. The Python code is a synchronized reference oracle, not a second runtime or stable public API. |

### Audit findings recorded so far

- Public compiler and kernels packages ship unbundled ESM and their release
  test rejects leaked `workspace:` dependencies. An unpublished private
  semantic-core package would therefore make installed public consumers
  unresolved once they import it at runtime.
- The LLD now permits `private` only during standalone Gate 1 incubation and
  requires a packed/release-tested `0.x` package before public-package runtime
  adoption. The alternative bundling path requires explicit proof and is not
  the current repository strategy.
- Existing architecture checks cover compiler-local cycles, removed AST
  backends, representation purity, and line budgets, but not cross-package
  direction, frozen adapters, stable capability IDs, or core `CUSTOM` growth.
- `cute_static_layout` is rank-one parser sugar; `TensorGpuPlan` is a 44-op
  shape-only/f32 backend compatibility plan; JIT has 36 executable
  `OP_CUSTOM` construction sites. At initial audit, none had a machine freeze.
- Compiler pointer/scalar behavior is spread across source-shaped symbol,
  alias, memory-reference, expression, and operation records. Its canonical IR
  does not retain every source local or emit `pointer-rebind` for every source
  pointer update; behavior fixtures must assert emitted store/copy/memory facts
  and outputs rather than imagined source-shaped nodes.
- Runtime assignment labels mix semantic features, runtime facilities, device
  features, oracles, simulators, external services, and policy. They are legacy
  routing requirements, not all `SemanticCapabilityDefinition` values or
  lowering decisions. Current repository-owned usage is 53 labels: 51 in
  profiles plus `shader-f16` and `subgroups` emitted by the browser mapping.
- Grad's current `bf16`/`bfloat16` path is f32 substitution. View/materialize
  behavior follows NumPy details: reshape/transpose/permute are conditional
  aliases, expand copies, and `contiguous()` currently returns `self` even for
  a non-contiguous transpose. These facts must be labeled compatibility debt,
  not advertised as real bf16 storage or a universal view contract.
- Compiler semantic types remain CUDA/source-shaped, kernels plan types mix
  scheduling and execution, and JIT plan types own framework scheduling. They
  are adapter inputs, not semantic-core source material.
- The LLD's initial view model conflated geometry and effects and used constant
  offsets despite dynamic shape support. It now uses symbolic byte lengths and
  offsets, puts access mode in L2 effects, and makes normalized `IndexMap` the
  sole executable coordinate truth.
- A second design audit found L1 allocation geometry mixed with L4 ownership
  and binding, content-derived IDs that would collapse distinct identical
  entities, an impossible freeze-then-brand order, and unbounded BigInt growth.
  The LLD now separates allocation spec/binding, scopes entity IDs, brands
  wrappers before freezing, and budgets integer width plus arithmetic work.

### Current constraints

- Preserve unrelated user changes in the dirty worktree.
- Do not claim a capability tier above its evidence.
- Do not add empty public abstractions merely to mirror the target package map.
- Keep the semantic core browser-safe and independent of frontend, runtime,
  Python, WebGPU, and native backend internals.
- New tests must follow the repository's discovered framework and focused gate.

## Decision Log

| ID | Date | Status | Decision | Reason / consequence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-001 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Keep this implementation ledger separate from the normative LLD and link them both ways. | Mutable state can change without silently changing architectural requirements. |
| D-002 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Gate completion requires all recorded exit criteria and evidence; partial implementation remains `partial`. | Prevents test counts or one successful demo from overstating completion. |
| D-003 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Begin with Gate 0 enforcement and concrete Gate 1 `/schema` and `/layout` capabilities; do not pre-create empty kernel, schedule, host, or capability APIs. | Audits confirmed existing models cannot move wholesale and speculative entrypoints would freeze the wrong seams. |
| D-004 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Treat semantic-core as private only during standalone incubation; publish and release-test it as `0.x` before any public unbundled package ships a runtime dependency on it. | Prevents workspace-only success followed by broken npm installations while preserving an explicitly unstable internal API. |
| D-005 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Normalize `LayoutExpr` into one executable `IndexMap`; keep dimension symbols, logical coordinates, and predicates as separate expression domains. | Prevents two serialized coordinate truths and accidental symbol-kind ambiguity. |
| D-006 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Semantic hashes use SHA-256 over canonical UTF-8 JSON, exclude provenance/transport metadata, and compose named components through a domain-separated canonical record. | Removes circular IDs, undocumented cache salt, and cross-language float/string ambiguity. |
| D-007 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Keep allocation geometry and alias identity in L1 `AllocationSpec`; keep ownership and runtime binding in L4 `AllocationBinding`. | Prevents value/layout artifacts from owning host lifecycle state or duplicating binding truth. |
| D-008 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Content-address only pure value nodes; derive identity-bearing entity IDs from deterministic artifact scope and canonical entity position. | Distinct identical allocations and views retain separate alias/lifecycle identity. |
| D-009 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Enforce integer-bit and arithmetic-operation budgets; deep-freeze normalized artifacts before placing them in an immutable opaque verified wrapper. | Closes BigInt denial-of-service and impossible post-freeze mutation paths. |
| D-010 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | V1 uses a closed byte-addressable scalar dtype registry and an affine/strided index algebra; swizzles and sub-byte storage require named extensions. | Prevents strings and backend spellings from becoming dtype/layout semantics before their bit rules exist. |
| D-011 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Minor additions are restricted to open bags with lossless unknown-field preservation; closed semantic records change only by major version or required extension. | Keeps old-reader canonical hashes stable instead of silently dropping new payload meaning. |
| D-012 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Keep the dependency-free Python implementation as an independent conformance oracle for the closed layout wire schema, synchronized atomically with TypeScript, fixtures, pinned goldens, and this ledger. | Provides cross-language drift detection without creating a second runtime or implying a stable Python package API. |
| D-013 | 2026-07-15 | accepted | Separate semantic capabilities/lowering/evidence from assignment requirements/resolutions and universal diagnostics; register legacy assignment strings as routing requirements rather than promoting them to semantic capabilities. | Prevents device facts, simulators, oracles, policies, and external services from receiving fictitious preservation levels or lowering decisions. Runtime may eventually consume only the narrow diagnostic, capability, and requirement protocol subpaths. |

Provisional decisions MUST be accepted, replaced, or rejected before the
affected implementation slice is marked complete.

## Change Log

### 2026-07-15 — Ledger created

- Added this durable gate/status/decision/evidence record at the user's request.
- Added `.wibey-test/` to `.gitignore` for local test-orchestration state.
- Started three read-only parallel audits: Gate 0, semantic-core seams, and test
  topology.
- Corrected the LLD's private-package direction after the seam audit found it
  incompatible with the repository's public unbundled package model.
- No architecture gate or semantic-core implementation is claimed complete.

### 2026-07-15 — Architecture freeze enforcement

- Added a versioned semantic-freeze manifest and a workspace architecture
  checker covering dependency direction, deep/cross-package imports,
  generated-source parity, required baseline decisions, and the three initial
  legacy adapter surfaces.
- Wired the check into root tests, compiler verification, release verification,
  and CI/publish workflows.
- Added mutation tests for union and interface widening, exports, dynamic and
  deep imports, inheritance, readonly removal, comments, custom-op aliases and
  positional labels, and missing required freezes.
- Kept Gate 0 `partial`: the current fingerprints freeze high-risk structure,
  not every semantic behavior or public capability claim.

### 2026-07-15 — Gate 1 wire/value foundation

- Added the private `@unlocalhosted/browsergrad-semantic-core` 0.1 package with
  only `/schema`, `/layout`, and `/package.json` exports.
- Implemented bounded duplicate-aware JSON parsing and programmatic-value
  validation, canonical JSON and domain-separated SHA-256 hashing, exact wire
  integers and float bit patterns, envelope normalization, exact budgeted
  dimension arithmetic and constraints, the closed builtin dtype registry,
  complete numerical policy records, and initial allocation/view/layout types.
- Added 43 focused tests. Kept Gate 1 `partial`: layout normalization,
  verification, traces, and cross-language fixtures remain.
- Closed review findings before commit: untrusted bytes are limited before
  fatal UTF-8 decoding; semantic hashes require an unforgeable internal
  verified-wrapper instance; constraint sets share one node/operation budget;
  resolved invalid divisors cannot hide behind unresolved symbols; bindings
  require declared domains; array accessors are never executed during JSON
  validation.
- Recorded architecture direction in commit `e16791d0` (`docs: define semantic
  systems architecture`).
- Recorded architecture enforcement in commit `6985611d` and the truthful
  row-wise attention naming correction in commit `aa632f98`.
- Recorded the bounded wire/value foundation in commit `d292595c`.

### 2026-07-15 — Gate 1 layout normalization

- Defined composition through an explicit source-coordinate map, removing the
  ambiguous scalar-layout composition interpretation.
- Normalized strided, permutation, slice, broadcast, padding, and composition
  builders into one element-location expression plus one in-bounds predicate.
- Added exact shared-budget index and predicate evaluation; logical out-of-
  bounds coordinates retain their computed address and return a false predicate
  instead of being clamped.
- Added stable layout diagnostic constants and seven focused normalization
  scenarios. Gate 1 remains `partial` until the normalized layout artifact
  verifier, address/alias traces, and cross-language proof land.
- Recorded this slice in commit `5d28bcef`.

### 2026-07-15 — Gate 1 verified layout artifacts and traces

- Added the closed `browsergrad.layout@1` payload verifier for symbols,
  constraints, allocations, index maps, and views; unknown fields, duplicate
  IDs, dangling references, rank drift, dtype drift, range errors, and
  alignment errors fail with stable diagnostics.
- Removed raw local IDs from semantic identity. The verifier hashes an ID-free
  provisional projection, then derives allocation, alias-set, index-map, and
  view IDs from the full scope digest plus canonical ordinal.
- Added byte and programmatic verification entrypoints. Only the schema-
  specific verifier can construct the opaque layout wrapper consumed by hashes
  and trace evaluators.
- Added coordinate/address traces that separately report logical, predicate,
  and allocation bounds and retain negative/OOB computed addresses. Added alias
  traces that distinguish same allocation, same alias set, and resolved
  same-root byte overlap without inferring L2 write safety.
- Added nine verification/trace scenarios; Gate 1 remains `partial` pending
  TypeScript/Python parity and property-generated proof.

### 2026-07-15 — Gate 1 cross-language closure

- Bound opaque layout wrappers to a private schema authority so a generic or
  foreign verifier cannot forge an executable layout artifact.
- Tightened static and runtime range/alignment checks, made alias overlap
  unknown for invalid accesses, and deep-froze all nested trace evidence.
- Added a dependency-free Python reference for the complete current closed
  `browsergrad.layout@1` schema. It independently decodes, validates,
  normalizes, canonicalizes, hashes, and traces artifacts under the same
  structural, resource, divisor, range, alignment, and predicate rules.
- Added pinned static rank-2/element and symbolic constrained
  rank-3/byte-addressed golden fixtures. Full canonical artifacts, semantic
  hashes, normalized payloads, trace outcomes, UTF-16 astral-key ordering, and
  Python-to-TypeScript normalized re-encoding are checked.
- Added 14 verifier-only rejection mutations plus dynamic trace rejection and
  dominating-predicate acceptance parity. The verifier corpus uses empty trace
  cases so a later trace failure cannot mask an incorrectly accepted artifact.
- Added 96 deterministic generated rank-1 through rank-4 samples covering
  contiguous, signed/non-contiguous, permutation, positive/negative slice,
  explicit composition, singleton/leading broadcast, padding, boundary, and
  OOB invariants. All 36 coordinate pairs in the canonical rank-2 fixture also
  prove valid-access byte-overlap alias invariants.
- Bounded divisor lower-bound proof before BigInt multiplication in both
  languages and added a differential integer-growth bomb. This closes the last
  resource path found by the principal-level exit review.
- Gate 1 is `verified`: its serialized fixtures now have one verified meaning
  and pinned deterministic hashes across TypeScript and Python.

### 2026-07-15 — Compiler pointer/scalar memory freeze

- Promoted `compiler.pointer-scalar-memory.v0` from documentary metadata to a
  required architecture freeze accepted by ADR-0001.
- Froze the exact 12-value address-space union; complete symbol, pointer alias,
  pointer selection, and memory-reference interfaces; the pointer-bearing
  index expression; nine memory operation shapes; and six root public exports.
- Added five versioned behavior cases for storage rebasing, byte-root vector
  reinterpretation, shared multidimensional byte addresses, cross-root
  selection, and pointer-array rebinding. Each case records only normalized IR
  facts, semantic CPU-reference output, and WGSL eligibility; source offsets,
  generated IDs, and WGSL text are intentionally excluded.
- Added mutation coverage for address-space widening, interface-field addition,
  readonly loss, operation widening, public-export removal, and missing fixture
  IDs. At this checkpoint Gate 0 remained `partial` pending Grad,
  runtime/vocabulary, diagnostic ID, and exact opaque-operation inventories.

### 2026-07-15 — Platform vocabulary and runtime requirement freeze

- Corrected the normative model: semantic capabilities, program-specific
  lowering decisions, execution evidence, assignment requirements, requirement
  resolutions, and diagnostics are separate records with separate IDs.
- Added a reviewed vocabulary registry with the closed nine diagnostic stages,
  the implemented layout/index-map capability ID, three concrete backend
  IDs, eight requirement kinds, and all 53 repository-owned legacy assignment
  requirement IDs. Static capabilities reject runtime/evidence outcome fields.
- Added a generated usage inventory for the 51 requirement IDs referenced by
  the ten checked-in profiles. Architecture checking regenerates the same model
  in memory and rejects a stale file or unregistered profile/mapping ID.
- Promoted `runtime.generic-backend-labels.v0` to a required freeze covering the
  exact eight browser-input fields/mappings, WebGPU-parent conditions, route
  modes, readiness states, runner targets, and three behavior fixtures. The
  compatibility API still accepts externally supplied strings; that does not
  register them for repository-owned profiles.
- Corrected platform guidance that inferred compiler/subset support solely from
  `features.webgpu`. Device facts now produce only device requirements, a
  loaded compiler is an environment facility, and source-subset/executability
  results remain attached to the concrete artifact.
- Exit review closed three P1s: source-subset/executability resolutions are now
  explicitly artifact-scoped, fixtures have their own requirement kind, and
  every vocabulary record is closed with validated capability links. It also
  closed the fixture-drift gap with a pinned SHA-256 and all 256 boolean browser
  mapping combinations; legacy meanings now define exact set-membership truth.

## Failure and Recovery Log

Record failures that may matter after context loss. Include the exact failing
command, concise error, suspected cause, resolution or next experiment, and
whether any files may be left partially changed.

- `pnpm install` failed with `ERR_PNPM_ABORTED_REMOVE_MODULES_DIR_NO_TTY` because
  pnpm would not recreate `node_modules` without a TTY. No source files were
  partially changed.
- `CI=true pnpm install` then failed with `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE` after the
  new workspace importer was added. This was the expected frozen-lockfile gate.
- `CI=true pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` succeeded and updated
  `pnpm-lock.yaml`; all eight workspace projects were installed.
- A semantic-core typecheck caught an `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` violation
  when forwarding an absent envelope limit as `{ limits: undefined }`. The
  call now omits the property when absent; typecheck, tests, build, and lint all
  pass afterward.
- `pnpm -r run typecheck` reached runtime after every other package passed, then
  failed at lines 675, 682, and 694 of
  `packages/browsergrad-runtime/tests/assignment-javascript-profile-e2e.test.ts`
  because `compiled.wgsl` / `compiled.wgslProgram` may be undefined. Semantic
  core is not consumed there; no runtime files were changed in this slice.
- The vocabulary slice re-ran runtime typecheck after dependency builds and hit
  the same three pre-existing optional-WGSL errors. The new fixture test and 53
  related runtime routing/profile tests pass; no runtime source file was
  changed.
- The first layout-normalizer typecheck found two `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
  errors when indexing already rank-validated stride/step arrays. Explicit
  post-validation casts document the invariant; all focused gates pass.
- The first artifact-verifier typecheck found an unused wire type import and an
  intentionally opaque JSON-model cast that needed an explicit `unknown`
  boundary. The first trace typecheck also caught three absent optional limits
  forwarded as `undefined`; all were corrected before tests and build passed.
- Exit review found that generic verified wrappers shared one runtime registry
  with layout artifacts. Schema-specific authority identity is now required,
  and foreign-authority forgery has an adversarial test.
- The first Python parity oracle structurally validated the positive fixture
  but did not mirror TypeScript's semantic range, divisor, alignment, and
  dynamic trace checks. The reference now implements the complete current
  closed layout-v1 verification path and a differential rejection corpus.
- Exit review found lower-bound positivity analysis could construct integers
  beyond the configured bit budget before the normal evaluator ran. Both
  TypeScript and Python now estimate multiplication width, budget lower-bound
  operations, and fail proof before oversized multiplication; an adversarial
  repeated-product divisor is rejected by both.
- The first rejection harness used non-empty trace cases, which could hide a
  Python verifier acceptance behind a later trace failure. Verifier mutations
  now always run with an empty cases file. The first Unicode ordering probe was
  also a literal spelling rather than an astral key; it now compares actual
  U+1F600 against U+E000.
- Final cross-language review found a wire `dimension` could name the internal
  `__bg_coordinate_*` evaluator namespace and be accepted only by TypeScript.
  Wire dimension references now reject all reserved `__bg_` names, with a
  differential regression case.
- The first compiler pointer behavior fixture assumed source pointer rebases
  would always survive as `pointer-rebind` operations and local pointer names
  would remain module symbols. The focused test rejected four of five cases.
  Inspection showed the canonical IR truth: the tested rebases are reflected
  in store address expressions, packed reinterpretation lowers to `copy`, and
  some locals are consumed during lowering. The fixture now freezes emitted
  operation/memory facts plus outputs instead of source-shaped expectations.

## Quick Resume Checklist

1. Read this ledger, then the relevant gate and exit criteria in the normative
   LLD.
2. Check `git status --short`; assume unrelated dirty files belong to the user.
3. Review the latest decision, verification, and failure entries before reading
   source broadly.
4. Resume only the current slice or explicitly record a scope change.
5. After work: update gate status, changed files, commands/results, failures,
   decisions, and the next smallest checkpoint.

## Next Checkpoint

Finish Gate 0's machine-readable Grad dtype/view/materialization inventory and
exact JIT opaque-operation decision matrix. Extend freeze coverage to those two
behaviors, then run the full architecture/compiler/runtime/JIT/Grad focused
gates before beginning Gate 2.
